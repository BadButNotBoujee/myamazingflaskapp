<h1> MY AMAZING FLASK APP! </h1>
This is a simple application that I created during our Lab session at university. It uses the Flask Framework and makes use of: <br/>
<ul>
  <li>Tokens to reduce the threat of Cross Side Request Forgery. </li> <li> Sessions for increasing security and performance on the client's side. </li> <li> SQL Alchemy for managing database requests.</li>
  </ul>
